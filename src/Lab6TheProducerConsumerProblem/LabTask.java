package Lab6TheProducerConsumerProblem; /**
 *The task is similar to the producerâ€“consumer problem discussed in the video.
 *The labtask.QuestionBuffer class is used by two threads.
 *The labtask.TeacherThread writes some questions to the labtask.QuestionBuffer at a random interval.
 *The labtask.StudentThread reads the Buffer whenever there are new values and prints those questions.
 *If the Buffer is empty, the labtask.StudentThread goes to a suspended state.
 *Whenever a new question is inserted, the labtask.TeacherThread gives the suspended labtask.StudentThread a wake-up call.

 *You only need to modify the labtask.QuestionBuffer class and print the buffer pointer at the end of the main method.


 * Best of luck.
